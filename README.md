  * College Mathematics for Business, Economics, Life Sciences, and Social Sciences offers you more built-in guidance than any other applied calculus text available. Its coverage of the construction of mathematical models helps you develop critical tools for solving application problems. Technology coverage is optional, but discussions on using graphing calculators and spreadsheets are included where appropriate.
 
  * The 14th Edition features a brand-new, full-color redesign and updated layout to help you navigate more easily as you put in the work to learn the math. Throughout, data is updated in examples and exercises. New features include Reminder margin notes; all graphing calculator screens are updated to the TI-84 Plus CD; and much more.
 
  * This print textbook is available for students to rent for their classes. The Pearson print rental program provides students with affordable access to learning materials, so they come to class ready to succeed.
